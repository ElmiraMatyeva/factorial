# factorial
The factorial function (symbol: !) says to multiply all whole numbers from our chosen number down to 1.

Examples:

4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24
7! = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 5040
1! = 1

So the rule is:

n! = n × (n−1)!

which says

"the factorial of any number is that number times the factorial of (that number minus 1)"

0! = 1
